# Envited-TA

##Landing page: “/”

- This page should replicate our design on Figma as closely as possible.

##Create event page: “/create”

- After clicking the “create event” button, the user should be directed to a new page where they can input their event details. This should include the following: Event name, Host name, Start and End time/date, Location and Event photo.
- Ensure there is a “next” button on the page – this should take the user to the “/event” page.
- This page has no pre-made design as we would love to see how creative you can get without the input from our designers. Remember to style it using Envited’s colours which are in your Figma file.

##Event page: “/event”

- After clicking the “next” button, the user should be directed to their event page where all details are displayed.
